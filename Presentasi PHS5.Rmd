# Getting it right, not just getting it published<sup>*</sup>

### Is "publish or perish" culture still relevant?
### How can we change the norms?
### Why is science too polluted by noises?
### What should we do to improve this situation?
### How is the best strategy to promote #OpenScience to academics?

# Changing the norms

--

- From `secrecy` to `communality`

--

  + We need to make our works **openly accessible** to everyone instead of **locking those up** in paywalled outlets
  
--

- From `particularism` to `universalism`

--

  + Despite **the reputation** (metrics, citation count), we should solely assess research impacts by **its own merit**
  
--

- From `self-interestedness` to `disinterestedness`

--

  + Treating science as **a competition**? Bad idea! It definitely [**hinders innovations**](https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/jun/15/is-competition-driving-innovation-or-damaging-scientific-research). 
  + Can we put our **love of knowledge** and our **desire to discover** something (useful) as our motivations instead?

--

- From `dogmatism` to `skepticism`

--

  + Stop putting too much time **to defend certain theories** or findings, start to consider **all new evidence**
  
--

- From `quantity` to `quality`

--

  + **Stop relying on crude metrics**. The real question that should be answered: have our research been done with **sound methodology**? **Are the findings credible?**

# Replication crisis is real...

--

1. Plaguing almost every disciplines

--
  + Including [medicine](https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf5027), [biology](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-018-0497-0), [chemistry](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jchemed.7b00907), [hydrology](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201930?fbclid=IwAR3nMcbsjpDOQxj9jxLBxYsrdTmcjBTUq3CsWydyW0pl-PPmwKe8hiZsOQg#f2), [psychology](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2628), and many more! (it's a long list, tbh)

--

1. The danger: Undermining **the credibility of science** (and scientists, too)

--

1. Integrity is **preceeded by** openness, transparency and sharing

--

1. Science and pseudoscience are no longer distinguishable

--

1. Cumulative science is not so useful anymore, because it is based on highly-biased estimation (due to publication bias)<sup>1</sup>

--

1. John Ioannidis<sup>2</sup> argues that "...there is massive production of **unnecessary**, **misleading**, and **conflicted systematic reviews** and **meta-analyses**. Instead of promoting evidence-based medicine and health care, these instruments often serve mostly as **easily produced publishable units or marketing tools**..."

[2] The context of this criticism is a massive increase of the number of meta-analytic study from 1986 to 2015, yet the studies were mostly sponsored by large industries with high potential of conflict of interest.

# A Manifesto for Reproducible Science<sup>*</sup>

- Protecting against (our) cognitive biases (because even scientists *are not free* from biases)

- Improving methodological training (this is what we *truly* need)

- Independent methodological support (do we need independent science critics?)

- Collaboration and team science (definitely, no more competition! we are *bad* at it)

- Promoting study [pre-registration](https://wwww.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1708274114)

# A Manifesto for Reproducible Science<sup>*</sup>

.pull-left[
- Improving the quality of reporting (complete & reproducible)

- Protecting against conflicts of interest

- Encouraging transparency and open science
  + Share materials and data, use open-source, reproducible software (`r fa("r-project")`, `r fa("python")` and many more)
  
- Diversifying peer review (why not make it open?)

- Rewarding open and reproducible practices (not relying on crude metrics)
